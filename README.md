# Tutero QA Assignment

## About

The first part of this assignment is a testing challenge, where you will write unit tests, widget tests and integration test(s) to demonstrate your knowledge of testing with the Flutter driver.

## Criteria

You will be judged off your choice of granularity and exhaustiveness of your tests, as well as the quality and efficiency of the code you write. 

## Notes

Your tests should account for both web and mobile/desktop platforms. Make sure you study the code-base and account for cases where functionality might be platform-dependent.

Good luck! ðŸš€
